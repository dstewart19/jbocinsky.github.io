I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Florida](www.ufl.edu) supervised by [Dr. Alina Zare](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/people/) interested in Machine Learning and Remote Sensing. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics at [Murray State University](https://www.murraystate.edu/) and worked as an undergraduate research assistant to [Dr. George Bunget](http://campus.murraystate.edu/academic/faculty/gbunget/) in the [Advanced Non-Destructive Evaluations Laboratory](http://campus.murraystate.edu/academic/ndel/)

[//]: (Along with research I am passionate about education and enjoy teaching and assisting with courses within the STEM field. I have previously been a teaching assistant for Physics and Engineering courses at Murray State University and am currently a GRE Quantitative Instructor for the University of Florida's Summer Undergraduate Research at Florida (SURF) Program. Outside of teaching within the classroom I have organized outreach to disadvantaged high-schools to inspire younger students and encourage them to pursue Engineering.)

When I am not working I enjoy running, playing guitar, golf, traveling, and beach days.
